#devices:
#  - /dev/sdb
#  - /dev/sdc

# Device discovery is based on the Ansible fact 'ansible_devices'
# which reports all the devices on a system. If chosen all the disks
# found will be passed to ceph-disk. You should not be worried on using
# this option since ceph-disk has a built-in check which looks for empty devices.
# Thus devices with existing partition tables will not be used.
# This mode prevents you from filling out the 'devices' variable above.

# II. N journal devices for N OSDs
# Use 'true' to enable this scenario
#
# In the following example:
# * sdd and sde will get sdb as a journal
# * sdf and sdg will get sdc as a journal
# While starting you have 2 options:
# 1. Pre-allocate all the devices
# 2. Progressively add new devices
